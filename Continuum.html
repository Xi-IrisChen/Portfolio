                <p>
                  Since Weiser’s vision, more and more interactive artifacts have been created: smartphones, tablets, laptops, TVs, smart watches, voice assistants…. We’ve become users of <strong>networks of artifacts rather than of individual ones</strong> and furthermore, we share and connect to each other’s digital artifacts. At the same time, <strong>the line between each artifact becomes muddled</strong>. Each capable of accessing various services and serving several and sometimes overlapping purposes. Accessing a digital service and content has become fragmented and the jarring cognitive switch between artifacts can disrupt thinking, productivity, and be a source of frustration and confusion. Therefore, the need for ubiquity across multiple artifacts and unlocking the full potential of artifacts around us has been enormous.<br><br>
                  So our goal was to <strong>pursue a continuous cohesive experience</strong>, where we ease the transition between devices.

                        <mark><strong>Why is ML needed?</strong></mark><br>
                        <strong>“I don’t know that I can switch”</strong> is the top funnel user pain points. We came up with two alternatives and verified needs through concept testing - user initiated switch and system predictive switch. Users highly praised the discoverability by predictive switch and felt it much more intelligent and convenient. But at the same time, it should be as less intrusive as possible. With sending prediction notifications, we need to be <strong>very intentional to make sure it only shows up at the right time, on the right device</strong>. <br><br><br>
                        
                        <mark><strong>What if ML goes wrong?</strong></mark><br>
                        False positive: False positives are where the system incorrectly predicts and pushes a suggesiton. Sometimes users pick up another device to work on a different task rather than continue the task. Sometimes users are just in the middle of something and do not have the intention to switch to another device even more appropriate. Notifications can be really distracting.<br><br>>
                        False negative:  False negative means the suggestion should show up but not which will not affect users too much as users are still able to accomplish a switch through conventional non-predictive methods. <br><br><br>
                        
                        <mark><strong>Deal with false positive: Co-learning and adaptation</strong></mark><br>
                        Whenever users dismiss or ignore a notification, we put it as the top priority that this scenario will never show up any more.

                        Products vary on where to switch.  <strong>“Should I do it here (original device) or there (targeted devices)”</strong> is one of the confusions users have. We also found users’ preference of where to switch varies in different scenarios. Therefore, we provide the <strong>flexibility to switch on both original device (send) and targeted device (receive)</strong> for easier access.<br><br>
                        <strong>“Where was I left off”</strong> is the bottom funnel user pain points. We ensure <strong>application states are synced</strong> and the system would jump to where they were directly after opening the application. <br><br>
                        <strong>“What’s my password again?”</strong> is another barrier. For your own devices, <strong>login credentials will be synced</strong> and users can open a state of an application without needing to put in their login credentials.

                        <strong>“Too many devices to choose from”</strong> is one of the top pain points. Most gestures have discoverability and learnability issues. However, if <strong>clear instructions of what the gesture is and the gesture built in an intuitive manner</strong>, it could speed up processes or perhaps eventually become a standard interaction once familiar to users. We use ‘point to’ as an example to indicate users can point the device to other devices.<br><br>
                        <strong>Gestures should never be gesture reliant, instead, should serve as an alternative way.</strong> In our case, users could choose the targeted device from the device list or use the pointing gesture.

                        Sal awakens early today. She opens her eyes and says good morning to Alexa, which is already her daily habit. “Good morning Sal! Do you want to start your day with news as usual?” Alexa says while turning on the light and rolling up the curtain. “Sure!” “Georgia Floyd….” Wait, only 8 mins and dead? Sal is thinking and picking up her phone. The news suggestion is already on her lock screen. She taps to open the news, watches the video and signs deeply. It’s a tough morning. Sal’s thinking.<br><br>

                        Sal then goes out for a run. She’s running quicker day after day and always satisfied with the numbers on her Apple Watch. After the run, she pulls up her phone to see more detailed statistics. Still, the suggestion is already on her lock screen. Sal clicks and quickly analyzes her heart rate and calories burned.<br><br>

                        Sal has a busy schedule today so she quickly replies to some urgent emails on her laptop. The alarm rings and she needs to catch the shuttle bus. She takes out her phone, taps the email suggestion, quickly wraps up the last few sentences, sends the email. <br><br>

                        Sal kicks off the meeting with a presentation. She opens Continuum, points her computer to Apple TV which then shows up on the top of the device list and she taps to mirror her slides. Several colleagues have things to update today. Every time, once the Apple TV approves, slides will be synced seamlessly...<br><br>

                        The meeting almost finished! Sal’s excited as tonight is her book night! She always plans a biweekly book night when she could immerse herself into books without disruption. Sal starts to plan what books to read tonight and compare different books on the phone. A suggestion shows up to switch to the laptop. “Oh, right! It would be much easier to do the comparison on the laptop!” Sal’s thinking. She taps yes. Chrome opens on her laptop...<br><br>

                        Sal heads to bed in the late night. There’s still one more chapter left for Machine of Loving Grace. Sal curls up in bed, picks up her tablet, taps and continues reading. “Such a lovely night” Sal’s thinking...
